A small indie project which helps users feel their mood or emotion through music and color.<br>
Even if you have no idea what you are feeling, you can cycle through different moods and find the one that fits.

**What it does?** (till now) <br>
->Changes the background color, text, font and music based on the mood <br>
->You can now type how you feel and listen to that particular mood <br>
->You can randomise any mood from the available moods <br>

**Future Additions**:- <br>
-> Adding animations <br>
-> Custom mood (probably) <br>
-> Audio Visualizations <br>
-> Adding fade between music <br>
-> Creating my own tunes to feature here <br>
-> Fix Modes (polish) <br>
-> A better alert system when music ends <br>
-> Make it so people come here to relax, feel their emotion, feel relieved <br>
-> A chat were you stay anonymous, there are real people who can give you the comfort you want <br>
